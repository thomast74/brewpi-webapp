# To do list

## Tasks

* Firmware upload:
   - use a special folder within web app for storing firmware binaries
   - part of the web app allows download of new firmware from github
   - user selects which firmware to upload
   
* retrieve sensor/actuator list from specific Spark

* StatusMessageVerification check if configuration version is different to configured one, and if remote ip address id different or empty
* create a web page that shows all Spark's and their current configuration 


## Ideas

* create webapp with basic design (header)
* shows a portlet all registered Sparks with link to Spark main page
* Spark main page, list on top of page and on the bottom the details with something to list actions
* detail page should have tabs: Details, Devices, Action Stream
* detail page Details allows to name a spark

* Spark connector to send data to Spark
* task to check Sparks configuration version. If no configuration or older one, contact spark and transfer config

* detail page Devices, lists all connected sensors and actuators
* detail page to tag a sensor or Actuator
* detail page set Spark mode (MANUAL, LOGGING)



* home page to list active fermentation
* home page to list Activity stream
* home page to start a new brew
* home page to start to show if a brew is active
